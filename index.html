            Flutter is designed to support mobile apps that run on both Android and iOS, as well as interactive apps 
            that you want to run on your web pages or on the desktop. Apps that need to deliver highly branded designs 
            are particularly well suited for Flutter. However, you can also create pixel-perfect experiences that 
            match the Android and iOS design languages with Flutter.
