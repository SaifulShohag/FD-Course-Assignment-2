            Flutter is a cross-platform UI toolkit that is designed to allow code reuse across operating 
            systems such as iOS and Android, while also allowing applications to interface directly with 
            underlying platform services. The goal is to enable developers to deliver high-performance apps 
            that feel natural on different platforms, embracing differences where they exist while sharing as 
            much code as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            During development, Flutter apps run in a VM that offers stateful hot reload of changes without 
            needing a full recompile. For release, Flutter apps are compiled directly to machine code, whether 
            Intel x64 or ARM instructions, or to JavaScript if targeting the web. The framework is open source, 
            with a permissive BSD license, and has a thriving ecosystem of third-party packages that supplement 
            the core library functionality.
